# 🚀 Akshay's 12-Week DSA Mastery Journey (Striver A2Z + LeetCode)

This repository tracks my **3-months, 3-hours/day** DSA journey.  
The goal is simple:

- Finish the **Striver A2Z DSA course**
- Solve **220–260 LeetCode problems**
- Build a **pattern-based problem-solving mindset**
- Prepare a **DSA system** that I will later integrate into my AI project **NeuroSec**

No shortcuts. No excuses. Daily consistency only.

# ✅ DAILY 3-HOUR SYSTEM (STRICT)

## **🧩 Block 1 – Concepts → A2Z (40 mins)**
- Watch **1–2 videos max**
- Write **only bullet notes**
- **Do NOT** grind all Striver sheet problems here  
  → Master the concept first, apply it on LeetCode

---

## **🧠 Block 2 – LeetCode Problem Solving (1 hr 40 mins)**
- **3 problems/day** (Sat–Sun → **4 problems/day**)
- Process for each problem:
  1. Think for **15 mins**
  2. If stuck → take **1 hint max**
  3. Try again
  4. Check solution
  5. Rewrite clean code from memory

---

## **📘 Block 3 – Pattern Notebook + Review (20 mins)**
For every problem:
- Identify the **pattern**
- Write the **mistake** in *one line*
- Mark result → **Solved / Hint / Fail**

This notebook is the core of the journey.
